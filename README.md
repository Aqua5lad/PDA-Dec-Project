## Programming for Data Analysis - December 2018 Project

This is the repository for Colm Doherty's December Project in the 'Programming for Data Analysis' module of the GMIT HIGHER DIPLOMA IN DATA ANALYTICS - 2018. The task is to simulate a dataset in python, presented in a jupyter notebook, with characteristics as similar as possible to a real-world dataset based on real-world phenomena.

### Contents of the repository:
This repository consists of a jupyter notebook, various image files (hidden), an Apache license, a license for the real-world dataset and a gitignore file.

### To read the notebook:
The jupyter notebook is called [PDA Project Dec 2018.ipynb](https://github.com/Aqua5lad/PDA-Dec-Project/blob/master/PDA%20Project%20Dec%202018.ipynb). To run the notebook, you'll need [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) running on your computer. Jupyter is included in the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) python distribution.
